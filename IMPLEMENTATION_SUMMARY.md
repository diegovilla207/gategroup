# SmartStation Implementation Summary

## Overview

SmartStation includes a role-based authentication system and supervisor analytics with these highlights:

- Secure login (Snowflake or mock data)
- JWT-based authentication stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Role-based access control (employee / supervisor)
- Protected frontend routes
- Supervisor analytics dashboard and inventory validation workflows
- Password hashing with bcrypt

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend files

1. `backend/config/snowflake.js` — Snowflake connection utilities and test helper

2. `backend/models/User.js` — user model (lookup, create, password hashing/verification)

3. `backend/models/Metrics.js` — metrics queries and mock data for development

4. `backend/utils/auth.js` — JWT helpers, auth middleware, role checks

5. `backend/scripts/init_database.py` — initializes schema, inserts demo users and sample metrics

6. `backend/README.md` — backend documentation and API reference

### Backend files modified

1. `backend/server.js` — auth and metrics endpoints, CORS and cookie-parser configured

2. `backend/.env` — expected environment variables (example provided in AUTH_SETUP.md)

3. `backend/package.json` — lists required backend dependencies (dotenv, snowflake-sdk, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, cookie-parser)

### Frontend files

1. `gategroup/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` — React auth provider: login/logout, user state, token refresh

2. `gategroup/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` — wrapper to protect routes and enforce roles

3. `gategroup/src/pages/Login.jsx` — login form with demo credentials and error handling

4. `gategroup/src/pages/SupervisorDashboard.jsx` — dashboard UI (metrics, productivity, insights)

### Frontend files modified

1. `gategroup/src/App.jsx` — wraps app with AuthProvider and defines routes

2. `gategroup/src/pages/HomePage.jsx` — shows role-based menu and user info

## Architecture overview

Authentication is based on username/password validated against Snowflake (or mock data for development). On success the backend issues a JWT placed in an HTTP-only cookie. Protected API endpoints verify the cookie and role before returning data.

Route protection uses a `ProtectedRoute` component that checks `AuthContext` and optionally a required role. Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/` (login). Users with insufficient role are redirected to `/home`.

Database schema includes `USERS`, `DRAWER_COMPLETIONS`, and `INVENTORY_SCANS`. Users table stores hashed passwords and role.

---

Security highlights: bcrypt password hashing, JWTs in HTTP-only cookies, role-based middleware, CORS, and parameterized queries. See `AUTH_SETUP.md` for production recommendations.

API endpoints (summary):

- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/logout
- GET /api/auth/me
- POST /api/inventory/flight
- POST /api/inventory/validate
- GET /api/metrics/dashboard (supervisor)
- GET /api/metrics/productivity (supervisor)
- GET /api/metrics/error-rates (supervisor)
- GET /api/metrics/efficiency (supervisor)

---

Frontend routes include `/` (login), `/home`, `/smart-bottle`, `/inventory`, and `/dashboard` (supervisor-only).

---

Demo users are created by the init script (supervisor and several employees). Use `password123` for local testing.

---

## Dependencies Added

Dependencies: backend requires dotenv, snowflake-sdk, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, cookie-parser; Python scripts use snowflake-connector-python and bcrypt. Frontend uses existing React + Vite + Tailwind.

---

Testing checklist: init script, backend and frontend start, login flows, protected routes, supervisor access, token handling, CORS and password hashing.

---

## Metrics Dashboard Features

The supervisor dashboard displays:

1. **Overall Line Efficiency**

   - Total employees
   - Total drawers completed
   - Average drawers per hour
   - Overall error rate

2. **Employee Productivity**

   - Drawers completed per employee
   - Hours worked
   - Drawers per hour rate
   - Performance badges (Excellent/Good/Needs Training)

3. **Error Rate Analysis**

   - Total items scanned per employee
   - Error counts
   - Error rate percentages
   - Status badges (Excellent/Good/Needs Attention)

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Performance highlights
   - Training needs identification
   - Workload balancing suggestions

Next steps: connect real data, add user management, audit logs, notifications, MFA and SSO as longer-term improvements.

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue                        | Solution                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cannot connect to Snowflake  | Check `.env` credentials, verify account access              |
| Login fails                  | Run `init_database.py`, check backend logs                   |
| CORS errors                  | Verify ports (backend:3001, frontend:5173)                   |
| Token expired                | Logout and login again                                       |
| Protected routes not working | Check AuthProvider wraps App in `App.jsx`                    |
| Dashboard shows no data      | Mock data is used by default, populate real data via scripts |

Reminder: change `JWT_SECRET`, run behind HTTPS and add rate limiting before deploying to production.
