## Phase 3: Testing

### Step 8: Access the Application

Open browser and navigate to: **http://localhost:5173**

- [ ] Login page loads
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Robot mascot visible
- [ ] Demo credentials shown

### Step 9: Test Employee Login

Login with:
- Username: `employee`
- Password: `password123`

- [ ] Login successful
- [ ] Redirected to /home
- [ ] See "Smart Bottle Analyzer" option
- [ ] See "Inventory Manager" option
- [ ] **DO NOT** see "Analytics Dashboard" option
- [ ] User info shown in top-right
- [ ] Logout button visible

### Step 10: Test Protected Routes (Employee)

Try accessing: **http://localhost:5173/dashboard**

- [ ] Redirected back to /home
- [ ] Cannot access supervisor dashboard

### Step 11: Logout

Click logout button

- [ ] Redirected to login page
- [ ] Session cleared

### Step 12: Test Supervisor Login

Login with:
- Username: `supervisor`
- Password: `password123`

- [ ] Login successful
- [ ] Redirected to /home
- [ ] See "Smart Bottle Analyzer" option
- [ ] See "Inventory Manager" option
- [ ] **DO** see "Analytics Dashboard" option (purple card)
- [ ] User role shows "supervisor"

### Step 13: Access Supervisor Dashboard

Click on "Analytics Dashboard"

- [ ] Redirected to /dashboard
- [ ] See "Overall Line Efficiency" section
- [ ] See "Employee Productivity" table with data
- [ ] See "Error Rate Analysis" table
- [ ] See "Insights & Recommendations" section
- [ ] Back to Home button works
- [ ] Logout button works

---

## Phase 4: API Testing (Optional)

### Step 14: Test Login Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"supervisor","password":"password123"}' \
  -c cookies.txt
```

- [ ] Returns 200 status
- [ ] Returns user object
- [ ] Returns JWT token
- [ ] Cookie file created

### Step 15: Test Protected Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/auth/me -b cookies.txt
```

- [ ] Returns 200 status
- [ ] Returns user information

### Step 16: Test Metrics Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/metrics/dashboard -b cookies.txt
```

- [ ] Returns 200 status
- [ ] Returns productivity data
- [ ] Returns error rates
- [ ] Returns efficiency metrics

### Step 17: Run Automated Test Script

```bash
cd backend
./scripts/test_auth.sh
```

- [ ] All 8 tests pass with green checkmarks
- [ ] No red errors

---

## Phase 5: Verification

### Step 18: Check Backend Logs

Review backend terminal output:

- [ ] No error messages
- [ ] See login events logged
- [ ] See database queries executing
- [ ] Snowflake connection stable

### Step 19: Check Frontend Console

Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console:

- [ ] No red errors
- [ ] No CORS errors
- [ ] No 401/403 errors when logged in

### Step 20: Verify Database

Check Snowflake (optional):

```sql
SELECT * FROM USERS;
```

- [ ] Roles assigned correctly

---

## Phase 6: Final Checks

### Step 21: Security Verification

- [ ] JWT token stored in HTTP-only cookie
- [ ] Cannot access token via JavaScript console
- [ ] Protected routes redirect when not logged in
- [ ] Role-based access works correctly

### Step 22: Documentation Review

- [ ] Read [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)
- [ ] Reviewed [AUTH_SETUP.md](AUTH_SETUP.md)
- [ ] Checked [SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [ ] Understand API endpoints

### Step 23: Production Preparation (Before Deploying)

- [ ] Change JWT_SECRET to strong random string
- [ ] Update CORS origin for production domain
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Set `secure: true` for cookies
- [ ] Remove demo credentials display from login page
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Configure backups

## Troubleshooting

If any step fails, check:

### Backend won't start
- [ ] Node.js version is 16+
- [ ] All dependencies installed
- [ ] Port 3001 is available
- [ ] .env file exists and is valid

### Database initialization fails
- [ ] Python 3 installed
- [ ] pip packages installed
- [ ] Snowflake credentials correct
- [ ] Internet connection active
- [ ] Snowflake account not suspended

### Frontend won't start
- [ ] All dependencies installed
- [ ] Port 5173 is available
- [ ] No syntax errors in code

### Login fails
- [ ] Backend server is running
- [ ] Database initialized successfully
- [ ] Using correct credentials
- [ ] Check backend logs for errors

### CORS errors
- [ ] Backend on port 3001
- [ ] Frontend on port 5173
- [ ] CORS origin matches frontend URL
- [ ] credentials: 'include' in fetch requests

### Cannot access dashboard
- [ ] Logged in as supervisor (not employee)
- [ ] Token is valid (not expired)
- [ ] Backend server running
